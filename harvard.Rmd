# Undergraduates, Want to Join?

Undergraduates in SRLL typically have the option to work with a graduate student and their specific research if interested. They work closely with the graduate student all the while being supervised by a faculty member of SRLL. 

For example, [Tahmeed Tureen](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/tahmeed-tureen/) worked with [Hyesun Yoo](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~yoohs/) during the 2017 winter semester and was supervised by [Dr. Susan A. Murphy](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~samurphy/)


If you are interested in joining, you must follow the following steps:

1. Email @umich.edu
2. You must include your CV or Resume in the email
3. You must write why you are interested in joining the lab and what you are planning to gain out of the experience


Once you are admitted to the lab, these are your expectations

* If you are receiving credit, you WILL be graded based on your performance and commitment to the lab
* You are to come to weekly meetings on Fridays (Time and Location usually vary) unless there is a class conflict
* Work with a graduate student/post-doctoral assisting them in research
* Present research posters at several symposiums
