The [Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~samurphy/nida/overview.html) (SRLL) is a research lab at Harvard University. SRLL also collaborates with the University of Michigan and Penn State University.


The research team is particulary interested in the field of mobile health. The research focus is on combining statistical inference methods (confidence intervals, hypothesis testing) with algorithmic methods developed in computer science for use in reinforcement learning and evaluating treatment policies (adaptive interventions and just-in-time adaptive interventions in mobile health)
